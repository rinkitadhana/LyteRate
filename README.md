### About :
- Presenting LyteRate, an e-learning platform where we provide a plethora of courses ranging from programming to life skills that too at the ease of our home. 
The MSP of our site included the student's community section, an integrated Doubt space for all our learners. We also added a tests section along ChatBot Dharampal, a one-stop solution for a student's queries.
